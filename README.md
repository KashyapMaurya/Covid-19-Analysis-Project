### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into Flight Patterns and their Prices over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Flight Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Data Train.csv" file, containing detailed information about each Date, Flight Pattern, Stopages, etc made by the company.


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall Hike in Price?
- Which Class is THE most Costlier One?
- What are the peak Flight Prices periods?

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The frequency has steadily increased over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from the budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
