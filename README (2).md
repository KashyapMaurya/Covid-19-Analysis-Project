This data analysis project aims to provide insights into Flight Patterns and their Prices over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.



### Data Sources

Covid Data : https://www.mygov.in/covid-19

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- Highset death toll in the State/Ut?
- Most Actice No of cases in State/UT?
- Highest Death Ratio

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Maharashtra has the Highest No of Cases Reported
2. Second is Kerala 
3. Punjab has the Most No of Actives Cases  

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from the budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
